# Draft Post

This is a draft post that's still being worked on. It has `published: false` in the frontmatter, so it should be skipped by batch processing when `skipDrafts` is enabled.

## Content

This post is not ready for publication yet. It needs:

- [ ] More content
- [ ] Better examples
- [ ] Review and editing
- [ ] Cover image

Once ready, change `published: false` to `published: true` to include it in batch processing.
